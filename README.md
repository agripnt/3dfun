# 3dfun
The 3D printed Dumpster Fire!
The folder contains the .3mf and .stl files for my version of the 3D printed dumpster fire with integrated 12 led ring.  

A Wemos mini D1 - V4 is embeded into the base and used to control the led ring via WLED. 
(note the "v4" version is important, other varients do not quite fit the same)


# WLED
The "_cfg" JSON file is the configuration file for WLED on the dumpster fire.  It can be imported to set up WLED to work with the 12 led ring.

The "_Presets" JSON file are the presets for the led patterns, and can be imported in the wled menu.
